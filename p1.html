        AI for Ordinary Investors
        If you aren't a Wall Street trader, you can still find ways to take advantage of the purported benefits 
        of artificial intelligence in picking stocks or timing the market - but it won't be found through most roboadvisors. <br>
        Instead, several exchange traded funds (ETFs) have sprung up that use professional AI techniques and then 
        allow ordinary investors to buy into that strategy through shares in its ETF.
        <br>
        <br>
        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, 
        and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,
        followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),
        followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
        After AlphaGo defeated a professional Go player in 2015,
        artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention.
        For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail 
        to communicate with each other.These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, 
        such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools 
        ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.
        Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions 
        or the work of particular researchers).
