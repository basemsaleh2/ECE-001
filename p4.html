        Financial technology used to be the back-office support function for bankers and traders. 
        Venture capitalists barely invested in the sector. Public companies in the industry were rarely 
        compared to the high-growth darlings of Silicon Valley. But all of this has changed. Over the last decade, 
        private venture capital skyrocketed and the share of investment dollars going into fintech increased from 5% to nearly 20%. 
        Fintech has found its place in the innovation economy.


        As fintech grew, it became increasingly difficult to tell the hype from reality. 
        Over the last several years, chatbots and artificial intelligence, blockchain and crypto assets, 
        roboadvisors and neobanks, and myriad other digitization symptoms have become buzzwords in the trade media. 
        Large global banks spun up corporate venture arms and digital incubators, investing in, 
        acquiring, or copying solutions from emerging companies. Globally, Eastern technology companies launched 
        messaging super-apps with hundreds of millions of users and embedded financial services, outcompeting the 
        potential of Western-regulated jurisdictions. American tech firms dug in deep, too, 
        finding ways to provide financial products without touching the third rail of regulation. 
        Here we are in 2019 â€“ trying to find signal amongst all this noise.
